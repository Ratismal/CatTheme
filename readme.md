## Terms

- This theme is considered to be a work in progress, and thus is not complete. It does not provide full coverage of Discord.
- This theme may completely break when Discord changes things such as class names or structures. There is no estimated time between these breaking changes and when the theme will be fixed.
- This theme will be updated WheneverCatFeelsLikeItâ„¢. There is no release schedule or expectancy for updates. Heck, there may not even be any updates at all.
- No public support will be provided for using this theme, as this theme is solely designed with Cat in mind and isn't exactly targetted at the general public. Have an issue? I don't want to hear it.

If you can't or don't agree with these, then don't use this theme kthx.
